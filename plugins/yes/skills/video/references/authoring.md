All commands and relative resource paths below are relative to the owning skill directory, one level above this reference. `<PLUGIN>` is the directory containing `plugin.json`.

# video

One video = a project dir with two files you write, built into one HTML
file by `build.py`. The page plays like a video (audio drives the clock) but
is HTML: no rendering step, fixes show up on the next build.

```
<project>/script.json   what is said, in chapters → scenes → lines
<project>/scenes.html   what is shown: one <section class="scene"> per scene
<project>/readings.json optional: {"表記": "よみ"} for this video
```

```sh
S='/absolute/path/to/plugin/skills/video'
uv run $S/build.py lint  <project>    # script checks, no audio (seconds)
uv run $S/build.py build <project>    # audio (cached per sentence) → out/video.html
uv run $S/build.py shoot <project>    # out/frames/<scene>.png, then LOOK at them
uv run $S/build.py unit  <project> --id ai-video --out DIR   # unit bundle (course calls this)
```

A video can also be one unit of a course (lessons + 確認テスト + outline):
that is `course`, which calls `build.py unit` for each video. Write
the video the same way; in a course, prefix every chapter id, scene id and
custom CSS class with the lesson id (`ai-c1`, `ai-1`, `.ai-flow`) because
units share one page.

`example/` is a short single-narrator example;
read its `script.json` and `scenes.html` before a first video, or build it to
try the pipeline.

Needs Docker running, `uv`, and Google Chrome for `shoot`. The bundled speech wrapper is resolved automatically; it does not need to be on PATH. ffmpeg and BudouX come in through uv. Return `out/video.html` as a local artifact. Publishing is separate. Credit `VOICEVOX:ずんだもん` is
shown in the 概要欄 under the player (with the chapter list); keep `"credit"`
in the script.

## Why it is built this way

- **One clock.** Each sentence is synthesized separately, its real length is
  measured, pauses are added, and the result is `out/timeline.json`.
  Captions, scene builds, chapter bar and transcript all derive from it
  (`out/unit.json` holds it). Never estimate timing from character counts.
- **Display text ≠ spoken text.** `text` is what captions and the transcript
  show; `reading` (or the readings dictionaries) is what is spoken. Any ASCII
  word not covered is a lint warning: fix it, do not ignore it.
- **Channels have separate jobs** (Mayer's redundancy principle: diagram +
  voice + the same full text on screen hurts learning):
  - voice: the logic (なぜ・だから). Name things; never 「これ」「ここ」「この図」.
  - scene: the structure — what connects to what, what changes.
  - on-screen text: keywords and labels only. Never the narration sentence.
  - captions: the full narration, on a layer the viewer can switch off (C).
  Two tests every video must pass: audio alone carries the argument; muted
  scenes plus labels carry the structure.
- **Recall beats fluency.** Clear videos make people feel they understood.
  End chapters with a `quiz` — the question is narrated, a think pause runs
  with a visible bar, then the answer is narrated. It works for listeners
  who never look at the screen.

## script.json

```json
{
  "title": "…", "subtitle": "…", "credit": "VOICEVOX:ずんだもん", "speed": 1.0,
  "chapters": [{
    "id": "clock", "title": "時計はひとつ",
    "scenes": [{"id": "clock-1", "lines": [
      "1文ずつ音声を作ります。",
      {"text": "画面に k8s と書いても", "reading": "がめんに クバネティスと かいても", "pause": 0.8}
    ]}],
    "quiz": {"q": "字幕のタイミングは何で決まる？", "a": "実測した音声の長さの時間表です。", "think": 4}
  }]
}
```

- A line is a string or `{text, reading?, pause?}`. Default pauses: 0.35 s
  between lines, 0.9 s after a scene, 1.4 s after a chapter.
- Scene ids match `data-scene` in scenes.html. Quiz scenes
  (`<chapter>-quiz`) are generated; do not write sections for them.
- Teach the substance: what the thing is and why it works that way, the
  problem it solves, use cases, trade-offs, when to pick it over the
  alternative. Never spend narration on meta — which lesson or category
  covers what, how or when something was announced (event names, changelog
  vs blog, release order), item counts. Beta/GA only in a few words where it
  decides production use.
- Writing rules (lint enforces the mechanical ones):
  - です・ます, conversational. 25–40 chars per line, never over 60.
  - Numbers in digits (`16回`, `3分から6分`) read fine; letters need readings.
  - Roughly 300 chars ≈ 1 minute. A chapter is 3–6 minutes and one claim.
  - Chapter shape: hook (question / surprise / common misconception) →
    concrete example → mechanism, built up step by step → name it → pitfall
    → one-sentence summary → quiz.
  - Open the video with a misconception and resolve it later.

### Dialogue (cast)

A script with `"cast"` becomes a dialogue video (authoring guide:
`zundamon-video`). Without it nothing below applies.

```json
{
  "cast": ["metan", "zundamon"],
  "description": "概要欄に出す 2〜4 行の説明",
  "chapters": [{"id": "c1", "title": "…", "scenes": [{"id": "c1-1", "lines": [
    {"who": "zundamon", "text": "語れないなら黙るしかないのだ？", "face": "troubled"},
    {"who": "metan", "text": "そう読むと誤解するわ。", "face": "smile", "style": "ツンツン"}
  ]}], "quiz": {"q": "…", "a": "…", "q_who": "zundamon", "a_who": "metan"}}]
}
```

- A string member has art in `characters/<id>.json`; an inline
  `{"id", "speaker", "name"?, "color"?}` member speaks with captions but
  draws nothing. `speaker` must be ずんだもん or 四国めたん. Other voices
  are rejected before synthesis, including through a custom adapter.
- `who` defaults to the previous line's speaker, then the first member;
  `style` defaults to `ノーマル`; `face` sticks per character until that
  character sets it again (first default `normal`). Quiz `q_who` / `a_who`
  default to the first member.
- Style names resolve to ids through `yes-speak --list-speakers --json`
  (once per build); lines are synthesized with `--speaker <id>`. `lint`
  errors on an unknown `who`, `face` or `style`, and warns when a caption
  runs over two lines.
- The page credits every voiced character and the art source itself
  (`data.credits`); the script's `"credit"` is ignored.
- `EV_TTS_CMD` replaces `yes-speak` (e.g. a fake for tests).
  `uv run test_build.py` runs the build's unit tests.

## scenes.html

The stage is 1280×720. A scene's content box is **1152×536** (top bar and
the bottom caption band are reserved — never draw there). Start with an
optional `<style>` for video-specific CSS, then the sections:

```html
<section class="scene" data-scene="clock-1">
  <h2 class="ev-h">1 文 = 1 つの音声ファイル</h2>
  <div class="ev-card" data-at="1" data-focus="1,2">appears with line 1, ringed on lines 1–2</div>
  <div data-at="0" data-out="3">visible for lines 0–2, gone from line 3</div>
</section>
```

- `data-at="n"`: hidden until the scene's line n (0-based) starts. This is
  how a picture builds in step with the sentence that explains it (temporal
  contiguity). Elements without `data-at` show for the whole scene.
- `data-out="n"`: hidden again from line n (for before → after swaps).
  Without `data-at` it is visible from line 0.
  Hidden elements keep their space; wrap the before and after in
  `<div class="ev-stack">` so they occupy the same cell.
- `data-focus="n,m"`: accent ring on those lines; other `data-focus`
  siblings dim. Use it to point instead of saying 「ここ」.
- Each section gets `data-line` (current line index) and CSS vars `--p`
  (scene progress 0–1), `--lp` (current line progress), `--gp` (progress
  through the pause after the line). Drive continuous motion from these,
  e.g. a playhead `left: calc(var(--p) * 100%)`.
- For anything CSS can't express: `<script>EV.on('clock-1', (el, c) => {…})</script>`
  where `c = {t, line, lp, gp, p}`. Must be a pure function of `c` — the
  page seeks, so no timers, no `Date.now()`, no randomness.
- Kit classes: `ev-kicker ev-title ev-h ev-sub ev-label`, `ev-row ev-col
  ev-grid-2/3/4 ev-center`, `ev-card` (+ `accent good warn bad`), `ev-pill`,
  `ev-big`, `ev-code`, `ev-mark`, `ev-arrow`, text colors `ev-good ev-bad
  ev-warn ev-accent ev-muted`. Color tokens `--accent --good --warn --bad
  --muted --line --card` (+ `-soft`) switch with dark mode.
- Visual rules: one idea per scene; show the mechanism, not a box with its
  name; labels sit next to what they label; keep a concept's shape, color
  and position stable across scenes; one accent color with a meaning; no
  decoration or background music. Body text ≥ 22 px, labels ≥ 19 px.


## Verify before publishing

1. `lint` clean (or each warning consciously accepted).
2. `build`; read its warnings (chars/sec on screen, missing readings).
3. `shoot` (default `--at end` = every build of the scene visible, the
   most crowded state; `--at start` too for scenes with `data-out`). Read
   every PNG: overflow past the content box, overlap with the caption band,
   tofu (□), clipped text, a build that never appears. Fix and repeat.
4. Save lines with readings or numbers using `yes-speak 'text' -o line.wav`,
   then listen to the WAV in an audio player. Wrong reading → add to
   readings.json → rebuild (only that line is re-synthesized).
5. Read the transcript (`out/transcript.md`) alone: does the argument stand
   without the screen?

Outputs besides the page: `out/captions.vtt`, `out/unit.json` (timeline),
`out/transcript.md`, `out/unit/narration.m4a` — reusable for an mp4 later.
Single videos default to 48 kbps audio (`"bitrate"` in script.json).

## Page behavior (runtime, do not re-implement)

Start screen with the goals (`"goals"` in script.json; no autoplay); the
end screen features the host's primary action, with optional `title`, `note`,
and `auto` (seconds until it runs). A key or pointer interaction cancels the
countdown; the viewer can also choose 「とどまる」. Replay and other actions
remain available. Portrait phones show this screen outside the scaled stage
so its buttons remain readable. Space play/pause, ←/→ previous
/next sentence, Shift+←/→ chapter, J/L ±5 s, C captions, T transcript,
`<`/`>` speed 0.75–2×. Click a transcript sentence to jump. Deep links:
`#t=12.3`, `#<chapter-id>` (inside a course: `#<unit-id>/t=12.3`).
Pausing writes the position into the hash so a reload resumes there. On
portrait phones captions move below the stage at readable size.

## Character art (立ち絵)

`characters/<id>.json` (`zundamon`, `metan`) defines each character's PSD
source, scale, base layers and faces: `normal smile surprised troubled jito
panic think angry cry`, each with a `[closed, half, open]` mouth and a blink
eye layer. `facing` (`left` / `right`) is the way the art looks as drawn,
seen by the viewer; the player mirrors a character whose `facing` points away
from the stage centre, so the two face each other. The `zundamon-video` skill uses both standing characters by default. Inline cast members are for requested voice-only dialogue or additional off-screen voices. Read ../../../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md before using art. The PSDs and exported parts stay out of git; they are fetched into
`~/.cache/video/characters/<id>/` (`EV_CHAR_CACHE`).

```bash
uv run characters.py fetch metan            # download + MD5 check + export; no-op once cached
uv run characters.py sheet metan -o s.png   # every face x mouth + blink, to look at
```

After editing a face, run `sheet` and look at it before building.
