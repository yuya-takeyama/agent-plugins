# slides

One deck = one HTML file built from `template.html`. The runtime (layout,
navigation bar, builds, permalinks, links) is embedded verbatim, so every
deck behaves and looks the same; you only write `<section class="slide">`s.
The result is an ordinary HTML file. Publishing is a separate user request.

## Authoring

Copy `template.html` (this directory) to `<topic>.html` in scratch and edit.
Never touch the blocks marked `data-slides` — they are the runtime.
Deck-specific CSS goes in the second `<style>`. `example.html` is a complete
deck that demonstrates every feature below; read it before a first deck.

**Content.** One claim per slide, the headline (`h2`) states it. 10–25
slides is normal; aim for ≤ 6 bullets or 2–4 cards per slide. Give every
slide a short `data-title` when its heading is long — it is what the TOC and
the bar show. Give a slide an `id` when other decks or slides will link to
it (`id="pricing"` → `#pricing`, stable across reordering). Put sources in
`<p class="src">` (sticks to the bottom). No filler, no invented numbers.

**Layout kit** (use these, not pixel positioning, so phones reflow):
`.kicker` `.lead` `.muted` `.small` `.mono` `.num` · `.cols-2` `.cols-3`
`.cols-4` `.cols-2-1` `.cols-1-2` (collapse to one column on phones) ·
`.row` `.stack` `.fill` `.middle` `.center` · `.card` (+ `.accent` `.good`
`.warn` `.bad`) `.pill` `.callout` `ol.numbered` · `table`, `pre code`.
Slide variants: `.slide.cover`, `.slide.section` (big `.num`), `.slide.end`.
Colors are tokens (`--accent`, `--good`, `--warn`, `--bad` with `-soft`
backgrounds, `--ink`, `--muted`, `--line`, `--card`); override them in the
deck `<style>` for `:root`, the dark media query and `[data-theme="dark"]`.

**Screen fit.** The deck is designed at 1280×720 (`data-size` on `.deck`
changes it). Wide windows scale the whole stage; when that scale drops
below 0.45 (phones) the deck switches to flow mode: each slide becomes a
scrolling column at readable type sizes. Landscape screens never reflow: a
phone on its side (or fullscreen) gets the full-bleed stage with the bar
floating over it, hidden after a moment and back on any tap. Safe-area
insets (notch, home indicator) are respected, so decks work as a
standalone PWA too. A slide whose figure is drawn in
absolute coordinates (scenes, hand-placed SVG) gets `data-fixed` and stays a
scaled 16:9 picture in flow mode. `data-flow="never"` on `.deck` forces
scaling everywhere (only for decks that are all fixed art).

**Builds (steps).** Every step is a permalink: `#5` is slide 5 before any
step, `#5.2` is slide 5 at step 2; `#pricing.2` works too. The opening
state (slide 1, no step) carries no fragment, so the plain URL is the cover. Opening such a
link lands on that state without animation.

- `data-step="k"` — appears at step k (1-based) and stays.
- `data-until="m"` — disappears after step m; `data-only="k"` = only at k.
- `data-anim="…"` — how it appears: `up` (default) `fade` `left` `right`
  `zoom` `pop` `blur`; `draw` traces an SVG stroke (add `pathLength="1"`);
  `highlight` is always visible and is emphasised while its step is current
  (table rows, list items, figure parts).
- `.dim-past` on a container fades earlier steps so the current one leads.
- `data-anim` without `data-step` = entrance animation when the slide
  opens; `style="--d:200ms"` delays it; `data-stagger` on a parent enters its
  children one after another.
- `<p data-step-pos>` prints "ステップ k / n" inside the slide.

Forward (→) animates; back (←), jumps and links show the end state at once
(transitions are skipped and one-shot CSS keyframe animations are finished;
infinite ones keep looping). The runtime's element defaults (`h2`, `p`,
`table`, …) have zero specificity, so a deck class always overrides them.
Keep builds purposeful: reveal a sequence, trace a flow, walk a table. A
slide that is read in one glance needs no steps.

**Scenes** — motion that CSS classes cannot express (counters, timelines,
simulations). Mark the slide `data-scene="name"` (usually with
`data-fixed`) and register after the runtime:

```js
YESSlides.scene('name', {
  steps: 3,             // counted into the slide's steps
  enter(ctx) {},        // slide opened; ctx.every / ctx.later loops stop when it closes
  step(ctx, k) {},      // draw state k FROM SCRATCH (k = 0..steps); idempotent
  leave(ctx) {},
});
```

`ctx.root` is the slide, `ctx.$` / `ctx.$$` query inside it, `ctx.animate`
is false on jumps (skip transitions, set the end state directly),
`ctx.later(ms, fn)` inside `step` is cancelled when the step changes and
runs on the next tick when not animating. Never keep state between calls that
`step(ctx, k)` cannot rebuild — a `#5.3` link must render the same as
pressing → three times.

**Sound (optional, off by default).** `data-sound` on `.deck` adds a 🔇
button to the bar (S toggles it). Nothing plays until the viewer turns it
on; the tap that does so creates the audio, so browsers never block it.
While on, moving forward chimes (a rising note per step, a whoosh per
slide); going back, jumps and links stay quiet. `data-sound="manual"` keeps
navigation silent and leaves every sound to the deck. The deck plays the
built-in synthesized one-shots with `YESSlides.sfx(name)` — `tap` `pop`
`step` `slide` `correct` `wrong` `xp` `levelup` `finale` — which does
nothing and returns `false` while sound is off (`YESSlides.sound` says
whether it is on). Never make sound carry meaning: a muted viewer must get
everything from the slide. Leave it out of decks for meetings and reading;
it is for playful decks such as the ドパガキ ones below.

**Links.** Use `href="#7"` or `href="#pricing.2"` within a deck. Link to
other documents with ordinary `href` URLs, or `data-page="other.html#3.2"`.
Single-page publishing hosts may not support relative documents. External
links use `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.

**Controls** (built by the runtime, identical in every deck; `?` shows them):
→ / Space / PageDown next, ← / PageUp back, Shift+→/← skip steps, Home /
End, digits + Enter jumps, G focuses the slide number, T or ☰ opens the
TOC, R replays the slide's animation, P autoplays its steps
(`data-autoplay="ms"` on `.deck`), S toggles sound (`data-sound` decks), F fullscreen (when allowed by the browser/host), horizontal swipe on touch. Decks of up to 12
slides show dots; longer decks show a slide-number input. Printing gives
one page per slide with every step shown.

## In a course (course unit)

A deck can be one unit of a `course` lesson (`{"kind": "slides", "src":
"lessons/x/deck.html"}`). Write it as an ordinary deck from the template;
`build.py unit <deck.html> --id ID --out DIR` (course calls it) keeps
the deck's own `<style>`, the `.deck` and the deck's `<script>`s and swaps in
this runtime. Inside a course the deck fits the unit's box instead of the
window, keys and swipes only reach the deck on screen, its position goes
into the course's hash (`#<unit>/5.2`), there is no fullscreen, and the last
step shows the course's next action. Section slides become the lesson's
outline. Several decks can share the page, so in a course deck: scope CSS to
`.deck` (never `:root`; the build warns) and prefix slide ids with the
lesson id. `YESSlides.go/next/state` act on the deck last shown.

## Verify before publishing

Serve the file over http (any static server; `file://` previews may not run
scripts) and check at desktop size and at a phone size (375×812):

1. No console errors; `YESSlides.state` shows the expected slide count.
2. Walk the deck with → once: nothing clipped or overflowing in fit mode,
   each step reveals what it should, the bar shows the step pips.
3. Open two permalinks with steps (`#N.S`) directly and confirm they land on
   the same state as walking there, scenes included.
4. At phone size every non-fixed slide reads as a column and scrolls.
